# Assignment: Simple Feedforward NN

In Java, program the simple feedforward neural network for XOR from [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWhGyPgts5U). (We watched it in class)

You can hard-code the two inputs, and the weights as well, but the network should actually perform the calculations from the video. (Sigmoid functions and all that)

The only output for the program should be the output of the neural network, and possibly debug messages.
