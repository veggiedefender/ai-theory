# PROJECT: WOT IN BACKPROPAGATION

Write a program that:

1. Initializes random weights (between -10 and 10) in the XOR neural network
2. Runs the backpropagation algorithm until Error is < some number (like 0.05 maybe)
3. Output: network weights and gradients after each iteration

Note: Do batch gradients if you can, otherwise rotate training data between iterations
